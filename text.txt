As per the current understanding 

"DayFile.EmployeeHistory,2,List,Count" --> this explains that EmployeeHistory is a table , 2 represents 
data information present on the 2 line of the text document , List represents the number of records , Count represents
that the data type is going to be a list

"DayFile.EmployeeHistory[],3,Obj,EmployeeID,FirstName,LastName,DisplayName" --> this states that the data type is 
going to be an object , with following as the Column names


and these two are somewhat nested tables or maybe a relationship exists between these 
two tables

DayFile.EmployeeHistory[].JobHistory,4,List,Count
DayFile.EmployeeHistory[].JobHistory[],5,Obj,JobName,Department,LaborCostGroup,LaborCostCode,PayRate,PayType


##### Questions to ask client

"DayFile.EmployeeHistory,2,List,Count" here it says count meaning the data type is going to be a list , however ,
"DayFile.EmployeeHistory[],3,Obj,EmployeeID,FirstName,LastName,DisplayName" here the data type is written as Object.
This is the confusion.

DayFile.EmployeeHistory and DayFile.EmployeeHistory[].JobHistory , is there any relationship between these two
tables?
